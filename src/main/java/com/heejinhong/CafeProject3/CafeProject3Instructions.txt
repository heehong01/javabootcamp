Project 3

We will continue the Cafe concept for this exercise.

Create two new abstract methods in the Product class: addOptions() and
printOptions(); Implement these methods in each of the subclasses.

Write a program that prompts the user to select products from the cafe
and select options attached to those products
(e.g, "Would you like sugar with the coffee?"), but this time include
store and shopping cart classes and include classes for each item
(you may use the classes created in previous exercises and add these
products to lists in the store and shopping cart classes). Options may
or may not incur additional cost, but you should have at least one
product that has options which do incur additional cost. Have the user
select items from the store and specify any options. Add the items to
the shopping cart. Print out a list of each item with price, quantity
and item subtotal along with the purchase subtotal, sales tax and
purchase total after the user is done selecting items (i.e., there
should be a choice on the menu to “check out” at which time the
purchase totals are displayed and the application quits.

Optional: Create and implement a custom exception
