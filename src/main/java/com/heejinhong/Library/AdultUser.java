to register as an adult” should be displayed in the console.
2. requestBook : if bookType is “Fiction”, a message displaying “Book Issued
successfully, please return the book within 7 days” should be displayed in
the console.
else, a message displaying, “Oops, you are allowed to take only adult
Fiction books” should be displayed in the console.
